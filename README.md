# MyFirstToDoList

This is my very first stab at coding, where I created a to-do list with some fun features.

This to-do list captures title & date information per entry and a user can:
- Add items 
- Delete items, either one by one or by clearing the whole list
- Sort the list alphabetically
- Search the list by item name
- Personalise the list by choosing a list colour
